# ids
The Open Source IDS used by vZOA on VATSIM.

# What?
This is an (I)nformation (D)isplay (S)ystem. It is intended to be used on [VATSIM](https://vatsim.net) as part of the operation of ARTCCs.

It is designed to be extensible and modular.

# Goals
Help ARTCCs operate better by providing their controllers with information about the current status of things happening within the ARTCC to make them better controllers.

# Non-goals
Completely emulate in either form or function the real world information display systems in use. This system is geared towards simulation and the specific needs on controlling on a simulation network.
